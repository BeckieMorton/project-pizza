# Project Name

Week 1 - Project Pizza. Build a Javascript Pizzeria.
Complete “Step 1-5” stated in the GitHub repo’s instructions. The Javascript asks the user to answer several questions to order food and confirm.

## The problem

My main problem was getting the program to verify if the user entered valid input and to then ask the user the question again (until they enterd valid input). I did this with a do...while loop and it works to validate numbers but I had trouble with dealing with text and changing/seeing if the prompt input was text/number. Diego helped me with options to achieve this.

I used both if/else and swtich statements in this project. I changed the colour of the HTML page as the blue was hurting my eyes! :-)
