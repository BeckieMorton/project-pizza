// ## Stretch Goals

// So youâ€™ve completed all the steps above? Great job! Make sure you've committed and pushed a version of your project before starting on the stretch goals. Remember that the stretch goals are optional.

// As a challenge to enhance your coding skills, consider refactoring the entire code by replacing the existing if, else-if, and else conditionals with a more streamlined and organized approach using JavaScript's switch case structure. By doing so, you'll improve code readability and maintainability, making it easier to manage various scenarios and outcomes in a more structured manner.

// We recommend creating an extra script.js file under the name `switch.js` to have both code syntaxes available.

// Step 1 - Welcome and introduction
alert(`Welcome to The Aussie Pizza House! Ready to Start? - Click 'OK' to begin.`);

// Get user's name
const userName = prompt("What is your name?: ");
alert(`Hi, ${userName}! Hungry? We are glad you are here. 
Follow the prompts to order your food.`);

// Step 2 - Food choice

let foodChoiceNum = 0;
let choiceFood = "Pizza";
do {
  //Present menu options (Pizza, Pasta, Salad)
  foodChoiceNum = prompt("What would you like to eat? Please type 1,2 or 3:\n(1) Pizza\n(2) Pasta\n(3) Salad");
  // I found the \n for new line option before our Tuesday lesson
  switch (foodChoiceNum) {
    case 1:
      alert('You have choosen Pizza!');
      choiceFood = "Pizza";
      break;
    case 2:
      alert('You have choosen Pasta!');
      choiceFood = "Pasta";
      break;
    case 3:
      alert('You have choosen Salad!');
      choiceFood = "Salad";
      break;
    default:
      alert('Your choice is not available, Please try again');
  }
}
while (foodChoiceNum >= 4); //do...while loop if user does not enter a valid option (1,2 or 3) they are asked again

// // Step 3 - Subtype choice

let subtypeChoiceNum = 1;
let subtypeChoiceFood = [];//allocate an empty array using []

// User selects their options based on Pizza, Pasta or Salad.
do {
  switch (choiceFood) {
    //Pizza choices
    case "Pizza":
      subtypeChoiceNum = prompt(`Select a Pizza type from our delicious menu below, by entering the number of your choice:
    1 - Margherita 
    2 - Supreme 
    3 - Vegorama
    4 - Ham and Pineapple`);
      subtypeChoiceFood = ["Margherita", "Supreme", "Vegorama", "Ham and Pineapple"];
      break;
    //Pasta choices
    case "Pasta":
      subtypeChoiceNum = prompt(`Select a Pasta type from our delicious menu below, by entering the number of your choice:
    1 - Spaghetti Aglio
    2 - Fettuccine Carbonara
    3 - Penne Pesto
    4 - Vegetarian lasagna`);
      subtypeChoiceFood = ["Spaghetti Aglio", "Fettuccine Carbonara", "Penne Pesto", "Vegetarian lasagna"];
      break;
    //Salad choices
    case "Salad":
      subtypeChoiceNum = prompt(`Select a Salad from our delicious menu below, by entering the number of your choice:
    1 - Garden Salad
    2 - Greek Salad 
    3 - Caprese Salad
    4 - Caesar Salad`);
      subtypeChoiceFood = ["Garden Salad", "Greek Salad", "Caprese Salad", "Caesar Salad"];
      break;
    default: // to show an error message. I don't think I need this as I have the switch statement inside a do...while loop
    // If an invalid option is chosen, show an error message and exit the program. alert("Invalid choice."); process.exit(1);
  }
}
while (subtypeChoiceNum > 3 || subtypeChoiceNum < 3); //do...while loop if user does not enter a valid option (1,2, 3 or 4) they are asked again. It does not work if user inputs text. Diego has helped with tips and advice on how to check if a variable is a number.

alert(`Great Choice, You chose Number ${subtypeChoiceNum} - ${subtypeChoiceFood[subtypeChoiceNum - 1]}`);

// Step 4 - Age

let userAgeAlert = "Adult"
const userAgeNum = prompt("So that we can prepare the correct size. Please tell us your age?")
switch (userAgeNum) {
  case userAgeNum >= 18:
    alert("You are an adult. We will prepare you an adult size portion");
    userAgeAlert = "Adult";
    break;
  case userAgeNum < 18:
    alert("You are a child. We will prepare you an child size portion");
    userAgeAlert = "Child";
    break;
  default:
    alert('Invalid input. Please enter a valid number (1, 2, or 3)');
}

// Step 5 - Order confirmation
let userConfirm = "no";
//display the user's order and ask for confirmation
userConfirm = prompt(`You have ordered a ${userAgeAlert} portion of the ${choiceFood} - ${subtypeChoiceFood[subtypeChoiceNum - 1]}
Is your order correct? Please type YES to confirm your order, or NO to cancel`);
switch (userConfirm) {
  case userConfirm === "yes":
    alert("Thank you, your order is confirmed and will be prepared ASAP. Thank you for visiting The Aussie Pizza House!");
    break;
  default:
    alert("Your order has been cancelled. We hope to welcome you back again soon");
}
//does not error check the user's input, they must put in 'yes' or 'no'
